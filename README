== Usage == 

add your RSS feeds to the 'rss_links' file and run the following:

ruby downloader.rb

This will download the enclosure of the first item for each feed link in the 'rss_links' file. The data will be put in a directory named 'downloads', in a subdirectory named after the feed description.


== Motivation ==

I needed this because some of my feeds get updated every day (e.g. for a daily chronique) and only carry the 'post of the day' (with no history whatsoever). This means that if you miss a day, there is no way to get the data from that day again.

The info is served as an feed item enclosure (an mp3 file in this case), so I needed a script to fetch that mp3 every day. 

Now all I need to do, is setup a cron job which runs my downloader script.
